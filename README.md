# HostingPlatforms
Final project delivered on Data Science program as a Data Science application for Hosting Platforms market

I got the data from https://data.opendatasoft.com/pages/home/, and I did a complete Data Science process, from exploratory analysis, cleaning and transfoming data, supervised and non supervised algorithms and finally some deep learning models to get the business conclusions.

At that moment I got two types of data: Structured (ratings, characteristics, prices, other variables related to rooms/apartments) and Non structured (comments and reviews of rooms/apartments)
