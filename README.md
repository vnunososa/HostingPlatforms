# HostingPlatforms
Final project delivered on Data Science program (developed on Python, using Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pygal, Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow Keras, etc) as a Data Science application for Hosting Platforms market

I got the data from https://data.opendatasoft.com/pages/home/, and I did a complete Data Science process, from exploratory analysis, cleaning and transfoming data, supervised and non supervised algorithms and finally some deep learning models to get the business conclusions.

At that moment I got two types of data: Structured (ratings, characteristics, prices, other variables related to rooms/apartments) and Non structured (comments and reviews of rooms/apartments)

The first Jupyter Notebook contains the exploratory analysis and the clean up of variables, also non supervised modelling to figure out the profiles on the data. Finally we can find supervised modelling through Credit Scoring methodology to show a scorecard to classify the best 30% rooms according to ratings.
